Hello, I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, working with [Prof. Ann Nowé](https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/ann-nowe), to explore and develop a safe and explainable (Multi-agent) reinforcement learning (RL).

I am also a Lecturer of the School of Robotics at Beijing Union University, Beijing, China since Sep. 2017, focusing on the state-of-the-art multi-agent cooperative estimation, optimization and control methods applied in the area of autonomous agents and sensor networks. 
Prior to that, I got my Ph. D degree in Control Science and Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jie Chen in 2017, and a B.Eng. Degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation in 2011, both from the [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China.

I was a visiting PhD at Loughbough University, UK, working with the Leader of the Communications, Networks, and Control Systems Research Division Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang from Jun. 2014 to Mon. 2015.

My research interests mainly focus on 
* Multi-agent cooperative robust adaptive estimation, inference and optimization under unknown system or measurement statistics and communication constraints.
* Risk-sensitive multi-agent robust control and RL under uncertainties.

## News
