Hello, I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, working with <a href="https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/ann-nowe/">Prof. Ann Nowé</a>
I am also a Lecturer of the school of Robotics at Beijing Union University, Beijing, China since 2017. 
Prior to that, I got my Ph.D degree in Control Science and Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jie Chen in 2017, and a B.Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation in 2011, both from the <a href="http://www.bit.edu.cn">Beijing Institute of Technology</a>, Beijing, China.

I have been a visiting PhD in Loughbough University, UK, working with the Leader of the Communications, Networks, and Control Systems Research Division Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang during Jun. 2014 to Mon. 2015.

My research interests mainly focus on multi-agent cooperative estimation, optimization, and RL algorithms and their applications in self-driving vehicles and data science.
