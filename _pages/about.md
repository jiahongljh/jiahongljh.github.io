I am currently a Lecturer of the school of Robotics (http://jqr.buu.edu.cn/), at Beijing Union University (http://www.buu.edu.cn/en/), Beijing, China. 
Prior to that, I got my Ph.D degree, Master degree and B.S. degree from the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex Systems (ICDCS) (http://csicdgz.bit.edu.cn/english/index.htm) at Beijing Institute of Technology (https://www.bit.edu.cn/english/) in 2017, 2012 and 2011, under the supervision of the Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Prof. Jie Chen. 
I have been visiting Loughbough University, UK (working with the Leader of the Communications, Networks, and Control Systems Research Division Prof. Shuang-Hua Yang during Jun., 2014 to Mon., 2015.

My research interests are mainly focusing on Multi-agent cooperative estimation, optimization, and RL algorithms and their applications in self-driving vehicles and data science.
